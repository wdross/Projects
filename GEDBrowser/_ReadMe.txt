This program will use the GED file pointed to by GEDBrowser.ini's File= entry.

The program can build a set of static web pages based upon the data found there.

By default, the program will revert people to their maiden names upon divorce.
If a person has a more desireable last name, go to the "To Do" feature and put
a new item with a Description of "LastName:bettername", and that will be used
to generate the person's name.

If a particular family is not to be output to the Web based tree, make an
internal "Family" "Note" that says "NOWEB".
